## 3.0.0- 2020-10-29

### Breaking

#### Variadic flags

Flags `--packages`, `--scopes` and `--exclude` don't support comma-separated values anymore (eg:
`--packages libA,libB`). Instead, you can pass multiple values per flag (eg: `--packages libA libB`)
or pass the flag multiple times (eg: `--packages libA --packages libB`).

If you use one of those flags _and_ you want to specify a custom `yarn.lock` file, you need to use
`--` to separate the arg. Example `--packages libA -- ../project/yarn.lock`
